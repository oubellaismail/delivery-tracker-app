### ⚠️ Infrastructure Drift Detected in Staging

A manual change has been detected in the `staging` environment. The current state of the infrastructure does not match the Terraform configuration in this repository.

This is an automated alert generated by the `drift-detect` workflow.

**To resolve this issue:**

1.  **Inspect the Changes:** A full plan of the detected drift is available in the workflow run logs. Review the `terraform plan` output to understand what has changed.
2.  **Reconcile the Drift:**
    * **If the change was intended**, import it back into the Terraform state using `terraform import` and update the relevant HCL code to match.
    * **If the change was accidental**, revert it manually or run `terraform apply` to restore the desired state from the code.
3.  **Prevent Future Drift:** All infrastructure changes should be made via this repository's Terraform code and the CI/CD pipeline. Manual changes should be avoided.
